@flow - for running some script given a certain names
@task - always use inside a flow for modulation and clearity
subflow- a flow inside flow for modularity and other multipurpose
deployment- for working with org./team to work on same thing for faster production
cmd> prefect deployment build hello.py:hello_world -n demo_deployment
    >prefect deployment build file_name:flow_name -n(for giving deployment a name) name_of_deployment
    >prefect deployment apply hello_world-deployment.yaml 
    #what is created after running deployment

#intermediatery
cmd>prefect agent start -q 'default' 
    #to run prefect agent
